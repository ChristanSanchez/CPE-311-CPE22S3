The recursive solution solves the problem by calling the function repeatedly for each combination of choices, leading to overlapping subproblems and redundant calculations. This can cause inefficiency as the problem size grows. On the other hand, dynamic programming avoids this inefficiency by storing results of subproblems in a table, which helps it reuse previously computed values, making it faster and more efficient for larger problems.\n",

In top-down dynamic programming, we start with the original problem and break it down into smaller subproblems recursively, solving and memoizing the results as we go. In the bottom-up approach, we solve the smallest subproblems first and build up the solution iteratively, filling in the table until we reach the desired result. The bottom-up approach can be more efficient in terms of space and time because it avoids the overhead of recursion and uses an iterative approach to fill the table.\n",

Dynamic programming is a more practical approach for larger, more complex problems because it saves time by reusing calculations. This exercise gave me a better understanding of when to use each approach based on the problem’s size and complexity."
